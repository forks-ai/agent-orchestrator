// Package reaper implements the OBSERVE-layer polling timer that supplies the
// LCM with the two facts the LCM cannot wake itself to discover: a periodic
// duration-based escalation heartbeat, and per-session runtime liveness probes.
//
// The reaper sits OUTSIDE the LCM's per-session serial loop. It only REPORTS
// facts — it never decides whether a session is "truly" dead. The decider
// (anti-flap Detecting quarantine, terminal-session rules) is owned by the LCM
// and consumes these facts through the regular ApplyRuntimeObservation entry
// point. A probe error is reported as a probe-failure fact, never collapsed to
// "alive" or "dead", so the LCM's failed-probe ≠ dead invariant holds.
